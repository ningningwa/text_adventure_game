Action Castle is the game that a warrior experiences difficulties in the path, gets back the crown, and becomes the king. 

## My Game
My creative game is a simple "Escape Room" game. I choose the topic related to room because we have been staying in home for a long time due to COVID 19. Most of the the structure follows that of my own home. And here is the background of the game. The person weaks up in the bedroom and see a label indicating he is prisoned and needs to get out. The only way to go out is to find out two keys that are stored somewhere. There are totally six places in this game, a bedroom, living room, balcony, kitchen, restroom, and also a afterlife place (heaven). There are some instructions about what you can do in a specific place. You should try your best to win the game. Trust me, the winner is you.
